            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Lastly, whereas there are many Christians in <hi>Greece, Asia, Moscovia, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> it was desired of him that he would more distinctly set downe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries wherein they lived, their superiours to whom they are subject, and their differences from the Roman Church, that it might more manifestly appeare, how idle are the common vaunts amongst the ignorant, of her amplitude, as though all the Christian world save a few Protestants shut up in some obscure corner of <hi>Europe,</hi> professeth the same fayth she embraceth and were within the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of her Iurisdiction.

<pb facs="tcp:172339:9"/> rending that wombe wherein they were new borne by the laver of regeneration, forgetfull of their heavenly embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, which is not onely to reconcile men unto God, but men with men, so farre neglecting their owne eternall salvation, as to be unmindfull of that most undoubted truth. <hi>He that is not in charity, is in death,</hi> trampling under foote that glorious legacy of their Lord and Master. <hi>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you,</hi> have in heat of contention, and bitternesse of their soules strained and racked their weake understanding, to make differences betweene themselves, even in the maine arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, and branded one another with blasphemy, and heresie, yet these unchristian and uncharitable dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are not to be imputed to the whole sacred community of Orthodox Churches, whose harmony and agreement in necessary poynts of Fayth, are onely to be esteemed by their confession, which by publique authority they have divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the world.</p>
            <p>How many are the differences both in doctrine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline betweene the Proctors for the Papall faction, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Discipline? some teach their Cheefetaine the Pope may erre, others that he cannot: some that he is subject unto a generall Councell, others that he is above it: some that all Ecclesiasticall authority is immediately in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church, others that it is onely in the Pope, and from him derived unto inferiour Bishops: some that he hath temporall authorities over Princes, others not: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning doctrine, some affirme that predestination both by grace, and glory is meerely from Gods free pleasure, others from foreseene desert and merit, some that all the bookes or part of them belonging unto the old Testament, which
<pb facs="tcp:172339:10"/> were not in the Canon of the Iewish Church are Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, others canonicall even in the matters of Faith: some that there is no originall sinne inherent in us, but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, others that it is both inherent and imputed: some that we are most freely justified, by the meanes of Faith, Hope, &amp;c others by the value, and merits of these vertues: some that faith is onely a generall assent unto divine truth, others that it is a speciall perswasion touching the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our sinnes through Christ, some that we appeare righteous in Gods sight, partly through imputed, partly through inherent righteousnesse, others onely by inherent: some that eternall life is due unto our workes onely by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods free and gracious promise, others through the merit of the worke done: some that all the morall good workes of Infidels, and Ethnickes are sinnes, others that they are without sinne; some that the B.

            <p>Although then some private men unworthy to take the Word of peace and reconciliation into their virulent and contentious mouthes, led more by passion; and their owne selfe pleasing conceipt, than by the sacred rules of the truth, and piety, have laboured to sow the tares of dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the vineyard of the Lord, and heereby have made crooked some few branches cleaving unto them: yet the generall societies of Orthodox Churches in the publique
<pb facs="tcp:172339:10"/> confessions of their faith, doe so agree, that there is a most sacred harmony betweene them in the more substantiall poynts of Christian Religion necessary to salvation.</p>
            <p>This is manifest out of the confessions themselves, which are these, the <hi>Anglicane</hi> the <hi>Scotiane, French, Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> former and later, the <hi>Belgy, Polony, Argentine, Augustane, Saxonicke, Wirtenbergicke, Palatine, Bohemicke or Waldensian</hi> confession: for there is none of the Churches formerly poynted out in diverse places of <hi>Europe</hi> which doth not embrace one of these confessions and all of them harmoniously conspire in the principall Articles of Faith, and which neerest concerne our eternall salvation; as in the infallible verity and full sufficiency of the Scriptures, divine essence and unity of the everlasting Godhead, the sacred Trinity of the three glorious persons, the blessed incarnation of Christ, the omnipotent providence of God, the absolute supreme head of the Church, Christ, justification by Faith through Christ, and the nature of a lively Fayth, Repentance, Regeneration, and Sanctification, the difference betweene the Law, and the Gospell, touching free will, sinne, and good workes, the Sacraments their number and use, the notes of the Church, the divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Magistrates, the resurrection, and state of soules after death.</p>

Moreover, whether as both the signe, and thing signified are exhibited to all, so all receive both, some to life, others to their perdition. So that we all beleeve the true communication of the true body and bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, onely concerning the manner of communication is the controversie.

And his second admonition is, that for the establishing of our consciences in poynts of fayth necessary to obtaine eternall life, we would follow our blessed Saviours Commandement: <hi>Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Why</hi> (sayth this devout and learned Father,<note n="b" place="margin">In Psal. 21.</note> speaking to contentious Christians) <hi>doe we strive? we are brethren. Our Father hath not died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate: he hath made his last will, he is dead, and risen againe. There is contention still about an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance as long as the Testament is not made knowne, but when it is published in judgement all are silent to heare it. The Iudge attentively listneth unto it, the Advocates hold their peace: the crvers
<pb facs="tcp:172339:13"/> command silence, and the whole multitude present, stand in a suspence, that the words of a dead man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his grave without sense and life may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed. Are the words of a dead man, and interred, so powerfull and availeable, and shall the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ sitting in Heaven be impugned? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, let us reade, we are brethren, why doe we strive? Our father hath not left us destitute of his last will: he that made it liveth for ever; he heareth our voyce and acknowledgeth his owne voyce. Let us reade, why contend we? Having found the inheritance let us lay hold of it,</hi> aperi, lege: <hi>open and reade.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, not onely of all the west part of <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, (now called <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and corruptly <hi>Natolia</hi>) lying toward the <hi>Aegean</hi> sea, as being very thicke planted with <hi>Greeke</hi> colonies:<note place="margin">Senec consol. ad Hel. c. 6. Plin. l. 5. c. 29. Isocr. in pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric. long. post med. Lucian. in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. de amor. non longo, ab init.</note> of which, some one, <hi>Miletus</hi> by name, is registred by <hi>Seneca,</hi> to have beene the mother of 75. by <hi>Pliny</hi> of 80. Cities. But on the North side also toward the <hi>Euxine</hi> sea, as farre (saith <hi>Isocrates</hi>) as <hi>Sinope,</hi> and on the South side respecting <hi>Afrique,</hi> as farre (sayth <hi>Lucian</hi>) as the <hi>Chelidonian</hi> Isles, which are over against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Lycia</hi> with <hi>Pamphylia.</hi> And yet although within these limits onely, <hi>Greeke</hi> was generally spoken, on the maritime coasts of <hi>Asia,</hi> yet beyond them, on both the shores Eastward, were many <hi>Greeke</hi> Cities (though not without barbarous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties among them.) And specially I finde the North coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> even as farre as <hi>Trebizond,</hi> to have bin exceedingly well stored with them. But, it may be further. observed likewise out of histories, that not only all the maritime part of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and speake the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, but most of the inland people also, both by reason of the great traffique, which those rich Countries had for the most part with Grecians, and for that on all sides
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172339:16"/> the East onely excepted, they were invironed with them. Yet neverthelesse, it is worthy observing, that albeit the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue prevailed so farre in the Regions of <hi>Antolia,</hi> as to be in a manner gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet for all that it never became vulgar, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished the vulgar languages of those countries. For it is not onely particularly observed of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> by <hi>Hierome,</hi> that beside the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue,<note place="margin">Hier. in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. l. 2. com. Epist. ad Gala. Strab. l. 14.</note> they had also their peculiar language, like that of <hi>Trier:</hi> and of the <hi>Carians</hi> by <hi>Strabo,</hi> that in their language were found many <hi>Greeke</hi> words, which doth manifestly import it to have beene a severall tongue: but it is directly recorded by<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. cirato, long. post▪ med &amp; Plin. l. 6. c. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> (out of <hi>Ephorus</hi>) that of sixteene severall Nations, inhabiting that tract, onely three were Grecians, and all the rest, (whose names are there registred) barbarous; and yet are omitted the <hi>Cappadocians, Galatians, Lydians, Maeonians, Cataonians,</hi> no small Provinces of that Region. Even as it is also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others, that the 22. languages, whereof <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172339:17"/> in for instances of differing languages.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, of the greatest part of the maritime coast of <hi>Thrace,</hi> not onely from <hi>Hellespont</hi> to <hi>Bizantium,</hi> (which was<note n="*" place="margin">Dousa. Itin. Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. p. 24.</note> that part of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the East corner of the City, where the <hi>Serraile</hi> of the Great Turke now standeth) but above it, all along to the out-lets of <hi>Danubius.</hi> And yet beyond them also; I finde many <hi>Greeke</hi> Cities to have beene planted along that coast, (<hi>Scylax</hi> of <hi>Carianda</hi> is my Author,<note place="margin">Scylax Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. in periplo Iornand. de reb.

               <p>Sixtly, (from the East, and North to turne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the West) it was the language of all the west, and South Ilands, that lie along the coast of <hi>Greece</hi> from <hi>Candy</hi> to <hi>Corfu,</hi> which also was one of them, and withall, of that fertile <hi>Sicilie,</hi> in which one I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I have observed in good histories, above 30. <hi>Greeke</hi> Colonies,<note place="margin">Strabo l: 6, in medio.</note> to have beene planted, and some of them goodly Cities, specially <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> and <hi>Syracusa,</hi> which latter <hi>Strabo</hi> hath recorded to have beene 180. furlongs, that is, of our miles 22. and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seventhly, Not onely of all the maritime coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> that lyeth on the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, from the river <hi>Garigliano, (Liris</hi> it was formerly called) to <hi>Leucopetra,</hi> the most Southerly poynt of <hi>Italy,</hi> for all that shore being neere about 240. miles, was

                  </gap>he Inland people also towards that end of <hi>Italy</hi> speake the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue. For I have seene a few old coines of the <hi>Brutians,</hi> and more may be seene in <hi>Goltzius,</hi> having <hi>Greeke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, wherein I observe they are named <gap reason="foreign">

Neyther was the vulgar use of the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue utterly extinct in some of those parts of <hi>Italy</hi> till of late: for <hi>Galateus</hi> a learned man of that Countrey, hath left written,<note place="margin">Galat. in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptione Callipolis.</note> that when he was a boy, (and he lived about 120. yeeres agoe) they spake <hi>Greeke</hi> in <hi>Callipolis</hi> a City on the East shore of the bay of <hi>Taranto.</hi> But yet it continued in Ecclesiasticall use in some other parts of that region of <hi>Italy</hi> much latter:<note place="margin">Bar. lib. 5. de Antiquit.

               <p>Eightly, and lastly, that shore of <hi>France,</hi> that lieth towards the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> sea, from <hi>Rodanus</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> was possessed with <hi>Grecians,</hi> for<note n="*" place="margin">Strab. l. 4 non long. a princip. Thucid. l. 1.</note>

               <p>And yet beside all these forenamed, I could reckon up very many other dispersed Colonies of the <hi>Greekes</hi> both in <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and some in <hi>Afrique,</hi> for although I remember not, that I have read in any history, any Colonies of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to have beene planted in <hi>Afrique,</hi> any where from the greater Syrtis Westward, except one in <hi>Cirta,</hi> a City of <hi>Numidia,</hi> placed there by <hi>Micipsa</hi> the sonne of <hi>Masinissa,</hi>

               <p>These were the places where the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was natively,<note place="margin">Hieron. loco supra citato.</note> and vulgarly spoken, eyther original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by reason of Colonies.

A third beyond all these, because those great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, among whom all that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had conquered, was divided, were <hi>Grecians,</hi> which for many reasons, could not but exceedingly spread the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, in all those parts where they were Governours; among whom, even one alone <hi>Seleucus</hi> by name, is registred by <hi>Appian,</hi>

Cities, all of them carrying <hi>Greeke</hi> names, or else named after his father, his wives, or himselfe, and yet there was a fourth cause, that in the after time greatly furthered this enlargement of the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, namely the imployment of <hi>Grecians</hi> in the government of the Provinces, after the translation of the Imperiall seat to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> For these causes I say, together with the mixture of <hi>Greeke</hi> Colonies, dispersed in many places (in which fruitfulnesse of Colonies, the <hi>Grecians</hi> farre passed the <hi>Romans</hi>) the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue spread very farre, especially towards the East. In so much, that all the Orient (which yet must be understood with limitation, namely the Orientall part of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, or to speake in the phraise of those times, the diocesse of the Orient, which contayned <hi>Syria, Palestine, Cilicia,</hi> and part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and of <hi>Arabia</hi>) is sayd by <hi>Hierome</hi> to have spoken <hi>Greeke:</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT at this day, the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue is very much decayed, not onely as touching the largenesse, and vulgarnesse of it, but also in the purenesse, and elegancy of the language. For as touching the former, First, in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and other places to the West, the naturall languages of the countries have usurped upon it. Secondly, in the skirts of <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe, namely in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and that part of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that lieth towards the <hi>Adriatique</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:172339:19"/> sea, the <hi>Sclavonique</hi> tongue hath extinguished it. Thirdly, in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> the <hi>Turkish</hi> tongue hath for a great part suppressed it. And Lastly, in the more Eastward, and South parts, as in the part of <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> that is beyond the river <hi>Piramus,</hi> in <hi>Siria, Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue hath abolished it: Abolished it I say, namely, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any vulgar use, for as touching Ecclesiasticall use, many Christians of those parts still retaine it in their Leiturgies. So that, the parts in which the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue is spoken at this day, are (in few words) but these, First, <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe (excepting <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,</hi> and the West part of <hi>Macedon.</hi>) Secondly, the Isles of the <hi>Aegean</hi> sea. Thirdly, <hi>Candy,</hi> and the Isles Eastward of <hi>Candy,</hi> along the coast of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Cyprus</hi> (although in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> divers other languages are spoken, beside the <hi>Greeke</hi>) and likewise the Isles Westward of <hi>Candia,</hi> along the coasts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Epirus</hi> to <hi>Corfu.</hi> And lastly, a good part of <hi>Anatolia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as I sayd, the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, is not only thus restrained, in comparison of the ancient extention that it had, but it is also much degenerated, and impayred, as touching the purenesse of speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overgrowne with barbarousnesse: But yet not without some relish of the ancient elegancy.

These I say, were the ordinary bounds of that Empire in the Continent: for although the <hi>Romans</hi> passed these bounds sometimes, specially toward the East, and North, yet they kept little of what they wanne, but within those bounds mentioned, the Empire was firmely established.

               <p>To this greatnesse of Dominion, <hi>Rome</hi> at last arrived from her small beginnings. And small her

For first, all <hi>Italy</hi> obtained that freedome in the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> at the compounding of the <hi>Italian</hi> war, as <hi>Appian</hi> hath recorded: All <hi>Italy</hi> I say,<note place="margin">Appian lib. 1.

               <p>These two, as I have sayd, were the principall causes of inlarging that language: yet other there were also, of great importance, to further it.

Secondly, the Lawes whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were governed, were all written in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as being in all of them, excepting onely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall Cities, the ordinary <hi>Roman</hi> law. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the<note n="*" place="margin">Digest. l. 42. Tit. de re ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicata. leg.

Fourthly, the generall schooles, erected in sundry Cities of the Provinces, whereof we finde mention in <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. <hi>l.</hi> 3. Annal▪ Hieron. in ep. ad Rusticum. Tom. 1.</note>
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others (in which the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue was the ordinary, and allowed speech, as is usuall in universities till this day) was no small fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to that language. And, to conclude that the <hi>Romans</hi> had generally (at least in the after times
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:172339:23"/> when <hi>Rome</hi> was become a Monarchy, and in the flourish of the Empire) great care to enlarge their tongue, together with their dominion, is by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> in his booke <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> specially remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.<note place="margin">August. de Civit. Dei. lib. 19, c, 7.</note> I sayd it was so in the after times, for certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were not very anciently, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with that humour of spreading their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, appeareth by <hi>Livie,</hi> in whom we finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,<note place="margin">Liv.

               </p>
               <p>But yet in all the Provinces of the Empire, the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue found not a like acceptance, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, but most inlarged, and spread it selfe toward the North, and West, and South bounds, for first, that in all the regions of <hi>Pannonia</hi> it was knowne <hi>Velleius</hi> is mine Author: Secondly,<note place="margin">Velleii lib. 2.

And the reason of it seemes to be, for that in those parts of the Empire it became most frequent, where the most, and greatest <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172339:24"/> were planted. And therefore over all <hi>Italy,</hi> it became in a manner vulgar, wherein I have observed in histories, and in registers of ancient inscriptions, to have beene planted by the <hi>Romans</hi> at severall times above 150 Colonies: as in <hi>Afrique</hi> also neere 60, (namely 57) in <hi>Spaine</hi> 29, in <hi>France,</hi> as it stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Rhene</hi> 26, and so in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and other North parts of the Empire, betweene the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> sea, and <hi>Danubius</hi> very many. And yet I doubt not, but in all these parts, more there were, then any history or ancient inscription that now remaines hath remembred.</p>
               <p>And contrarywise in those Countries, where fewest Colonies were planted, the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue grew nothing so common: as for example here in <hi>Brittaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Eboracum 2 Debuna. 3 Isca. 4 Camalodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. Onuphr. in Imper.

               <p>And indeed, how hard a matter is it, utterly to abolish a vulgar language, in a populous countrey, where the Conquerours are in number farre inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the native inhabitants, whatsoever arte be practised to bring it about, may well appeare by the vaine attempt of our <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour▪ who although he compelled the <hi>English,</hi> to teach their young children in the Schooles nothing but <hi>French,</hi> and set downe all the Lawes of the Land in <hi>French,</hi> and inforced all pleadings at the Law to be performed in that language (which custome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till King <hi>Edward</hi> the third his daies, who disanulled it) purposing thereby to have conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the language together with the Land, and to have made all <hi>French:</hi> yet the number of <hi>English</hi> farre exceeding the <hi>Normans,</hi> all was but labour lost, and obtained no further effect, then the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

So that, in those Countries onely the mutation of languages hath ensued upon conquests, where eyther the ancient inhabitants have beene destroyed or driven forth, as we see in our Countrey to have followed of the <hi>Saxons</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, against the <hi>Brittains,</hi> or else at least in such sort diminished, that in number they remained inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or but little superiour to the Conquerours, whose reputation, and authority might prevaile more then a small excesse of multitude▪ But (that I digresse no further) because certaine Countries are specially alleaged, in which the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue is supposed most to have prevailed, I will restraine my discourse to them alone.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172339:28"/> part of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue so prevailed, the reason is easie to be assigned, by that we finde in <hi>Pliny.</hi> Namely, that in <hi>Baetica,</hi> were eight <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, eight Municipall Cities,<note place="margin">Plin. 3. c. 1.

               <p>Lastly, to speake of the <hi>Pannonian</hi> tongue, <hi>(Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi> contayned <hi>Hungary, Austria, Stiria,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia)</hi> it is certaine, that the <hi>Roman</hi> did not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it: For first, <hi>Paterculus</hi> (who is the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that I know alleaged for that purpose) sayth not, that it was become the language of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for how could it, being but even then newly conquered by <hi>Tiberius Caesar?</hi> but onely, that in the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> by <hi>Tiberius</hi> his meanes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue was spred in all <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> And secondly, <hi>Tacitus</hi> after <hi>Tiberius</hi> his time, hath recorded, that the <hi>Osi</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib.

               </p>
               <p>And as for these reasons it may well seeme that the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue became not the vulgar language in any of those parts of the Empire, which yet are specially instanced, for the large vulgarity of it: So have I other reasons to perswade me that it was not in those parts, nor in any other forraine Countries subject to the Empire, eyther generally or perfectly spoken. Not generally (I say) because it is hard to conceive, that any whole Countries, specially, because so large as the mentioned are,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172339:29"/> should generally speake two languages, their owne native, and the <hi>Roman.</hi> Secondly, there was not any law at all of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to enforce the subdued Nations, eyther to use vulgarly the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, or not to use their owne native languages (and very extreame, and unreasonable, had such Lords beene, as should compell men by lawes, both to doe, and to speake, onely what pleased them.) Neither doe I see any other necessity, or any provocation, to bring them to it, except for some speciall sort of men, as Merchants, and Citizens, for their better traffique, and trade, Lawyers for the knowledge, and practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, which carried force through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Empire (except priviledged places) scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for learning, souldiers, for their better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> Travailers, Gentlemen, Officers, or such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as might have occasion of affaires, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Romans.</hi> But it soundeth altogether unlike a truth, that the poore scattered people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Countrey, dwelling eyther in solitary places, or in the small townes, and villages, eyther generally spake it, or could possibly attaine unto it. An example whereof, for the better evidence, may at this day be noted; in those parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> which are subject to the dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> for, as <hi>Bellonius</hi> hath observed, the people that dwell in the principall Townes,<note place="margin">Bellon. Obseruat. l. 1, c. 4.</note> and Cities, subject to the <hi>Turke,</hi> by reason of their trade, speake both the <hi>Greeke,</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkish</hi> tongues, as they also that are under the <hi>Venetians,</hi> both the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> but the Countrey people under both governments,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172339:29"/> speake onely <hi>Greeke.</hi> So likewise in <hi>Sardinia</hi> as is recorded by<note n="*" place="margin">Gesner. in Mithridate. in Lingua Sardie &amp; Rocca de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect. in Ling.

               </p>
               <p>And certainely much lesse can I perswade my selfe,<note place="margin">Porcacch. l. dello Isole. nel discrit. di Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digna.</note> that it was spoken abroad in the Provinces perfectly. First, because it seemes unpossible for forrain nations, specially for the rude, and common people, to attaine the right pronouncing of it, who as we know doe ordinarily much mistake the true pronouncing of their native language: for which very cause, we see the <hi>Chaldee</hi> tongue, to have dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into the <hi>Syriaque</hi> among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had conversed 70 yeeres together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> And moreover,<note place="margin">Vide August. in Enarrat. Psalm. 123, &amp;, 138, &amp;, l. 2. de. doctrin. Chris. c. 13, &amp; Tract. 7. in Ioan.</note> by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we see in many, with what labour, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, even in the very schooles, and in the most docible part of their age, the right speaking of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue is attained. And to conclude, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Augustine</hi> in sundry places, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tongue was unperfect among the <hi>Africans,</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Colonies) as pronouncing <hi>ossum</hi> for <hi>os, floriet</hi> for <hi>florebit, dolus</hi> for <hi>dolor,</hi> and such like, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he confesseth, he was faine sometimes to use words that were no Latine, to the end they might understand him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He common opinion, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that these Nations in the flourish of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, spake vulgarly, and rightly the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, is, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture of the Northerne barbarous Nations among the ancient Inhabitants, was the cause of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, into the Languages which now they speake, the Languages becomming mingled, as the Nations themselves were. Who, while they were enforced to attemper, and frame their speech▪ one to the understanding of another, for else they could not mutually expresse their mindes (which is the end for which nature hath given speech to men) they degenerated both, and so came to this medly, wherein now we finde them.</p>
               <p>Which opinion if it were true, the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue must of necessity have it beginning about the 480 yeere of our Saviour: because, at that time, the Barbarous Nations began first to inhabite <hi>Italy,</hi> under <hi>Odoacer,</hi> for although they had entred, and wasted <hi>Italy</hi> long before, as first, the <hi>Gothes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Alaricus,</hi> about the yeere 414.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172339:30"/> under <hi>Attila,</hi> about An. 450. Then the <hi>Wandales</hi> under <hi>Gensericus,</hi> crossing the sea out of <hi>Afrique,</hi> about An. 456 (to omit some other invasions of those barbarous Nations, because they prospered not) yet none of these, setled themselves to stay, &amp; inhabite <hi>Italy,</hi> till the <hi>Heruli,</hi> as I sayd, under <hi>Odoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> about An. 480. or a little before, entred and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed it neere hand 20 yeeres, He being (proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves) King of <hi>Italy▪</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 16 yeeres, and his people becomming inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters of the Countrey. But, they also, within 20 yeeres after their entrance, were in a manner rooted out of <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Theodoricus</hi> King of <hi>Gothes,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them onely a part of <hi>Piemont</hi> above <hi>Turin</hi> to inhabite: for <hi>Theodoricus</hi> being by <hi>Zeno</hi> then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, invested with the title of King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having overcome <hi>Odoacer,</hi> somewhat afore the yeere 500, ruled peaceably a long time, as King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and certaine others of the <hi>Gothes</hi> Nations suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded after him in the same government, the <hi>Gothes</hi> in the mean space, growing into one with the <hi>Italians,</hi> for the space neere hand of 60 yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although after that, the dominion of <hi>Italy,</hi> was by <hi>Narses</hi> againe recovered to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the time of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and many of the <hi>Gothes</hi> expelled <hi>Italy,</hi> yet farre more of them remained, <hi>Italy</hi> in that long time, being growne well with their seed, and posterity. The <hi>Heruli</hi> therefore, with their associats were the first, and the <hi>Gothes</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of the barbarous Nations, that inhabited <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> The third, and the last, were the <hi>Langbards,</hi> who comming into <hi>Italy</hi> about the yeere 570, and

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172339:31"/> began to cry out, <hi>torna, torna,</hi> and so fell to flying away.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> tongue, if that afore mentioned were the cause of it, began a little before, in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the 3, when in a manner, all the West part of the Empire fell away, (and among the rest our Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> being first forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, by reason of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous warres at their owne doores, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conquered, and possessed by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whose posterity for the most part we are) namely, about the yeere 450: <hi>France</hi> being then subdued, and peaceably possessed, by the <hi>Frankes</hi> &amp; <hi>Burgundions,</hi> nations of <hi>Germany:</hi> the <hi>Burgundions</hi> occupying the Eastward, and outward parts of it, toward the river of <hi>Rhene,</hi> and the <hi>Franks,</hi> all the inner Region. For although <hi>France</hi> before that had beene invaded by the <hi>Wandali, Suevi,</hi> and <hi>Alani,</hi> and after by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who having obtained <hi>Aquitayne</hi> for their seate, and habitation, by the grant of the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi> expelled the former into <hi>Spaine</hi> about An. 410: yet notwithstanding, till the Conquest made by the <hi>Franks,</hi> and <hi>Burgundions,</hi> it was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, nor for any long time mingled with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which after that Conquest began to spread over <hi>France,</hi> and to become native inhabitants of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>But of all, the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue for this cause, must necessarily be most ancient: for the <hi>Wandals,</hi> and <hi>Alani,</hi> being expelled <hi>France,</hi> about the yeere 410. began then to invade, and to inhabite <hi>Spaine,</hi> which they held, and possessed many yeeres, till the <hi>Gothes</hi>

Notwithstanding, even they also, within lesse then 300 yeeres after, were driven by the <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Afrique</hi> into the Northerne, and mountainous parts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> namely <hi>Austria, Biscay,</hi> and <hi>Guipuscoa,</hi> till after a long course of time, by little, and little they recovered it, out of their hands againe, which was at last fully accomplished by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not past 120 yeeres agoe, there having passed in the meane time, from the <hi>Mores</hi> first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> till their last possession in <hi>Granada,</hi> about 770 yeeres.</p>
               <p>Whereby you may see also, when the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue began to degenerate in <hi>Afrique,</hi> (if that also, as is supposed spake vulgarly the Latine tongue, and if the mixture of barbarous people were cause of the decay, &amp; corruption of it) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about the yeere 430, for about that time, the <hi>Waudali,</hi> and <hi>Alani,</hi> partly wearied with the <hi>Gottish</hi> warre in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and partly invited by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> entered <hi>Afrique,</hi> under the leading of <hi>Gensericus,</hi> a part whereof for a time, they held quietly, for the Emperour <hi>Valentinianus</hi> gift: But shortly after, in the same Emperours time, when all the West Provinces in a manner fell utterly away

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:172339:33"/> the other barbarous Nations of obscurer names, being partly consumed with the warre, and partly passing into the more famous appellations. And secondly, you may observe, that the maine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Empire, especially in <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> fell in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere 450, being caused by the barbarous Nations of the North (as after did the like dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Empire in <hi>Asia,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> in the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> about the yeere 640) and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the raigne of the Empire in the West by the inundation of the foresayd barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue in all the countries, where it was vulgarly spoken (if it were rightly spoken any where in the West) became corrupted.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the <hi>Spanish, French,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> tongues, proceeded from this cause, as a great number of learned men, suppose they did, you see what the antiquity of them is: But to deliver plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my opinion, having searched as farre as I could into the originals of those languages, and having pondered what in my reading, and in my reason I found touching them, I am of another minde (as some learned men also are) namely, that all those tongues are more ancient, and have not sprung from the corruption of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, by the inundation, and mixture of barbarous people in these Provinces, but from the first unperfect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and receiving of it, in those forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Which unperfectnes notwithstanding of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue in those parts, although it had, as I take it, beginning from this evill framing of forrain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172339:33"/> tongues to the right pronouncing of the <hi>Latine,</hi> yet I withall easily beleeve, and acknowledge, that it was greatly increased, by the mixing, and coalition of the barbarous Nations. So that mee thinkes, I have observed three degrees of corruption in the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, by the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating whereof, these Languages are supposed to have received their beginning. The first of them was in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, where, towards the latter end of the Common-wealth, and after, in the time of the Empire, the infinite multitude of servants (which exceedingly exceeded the number of free borne Citizens) together with the unspeakeable confluence of strangers, from all Provinces, did much impaire the purenesse of their Language, and as <hi>Isidore</hi> hath observed,<note place="margin">Isidor. Origin. l. 9. c. 1. Tertul. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologet. adu. Gentes. c. 6.</note> brought many barbarismes and soloecismes into it. Insomuch, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his time, when as yet none of the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had by invasion touched <hi>Italy</hi> (for he lived under <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> government) chargeth the <hi>Romans</hi> to have renounced the Language of their fathers. The second steppe was the unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect impression (that I touched before) made of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue abroad in the forraine Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among strangers, whose tongues could not perfectly frame to speake it aright. And certainely,<note place="margin">Cicer. l. 3. de Oratore.</note> if the <hi>Italians</hi> themselves, as is remembred by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> failed of the right, and perfect <hi>Roman</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation, I see not how the tongues of strange Nations, such as the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were, should exactly utter it. And the third, was that mixture of many barbarous people (to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:172339:34"/> attribute the beginning of the Languages in question) which made the <hi>Latine,</hi> that was before unperfect, yet more corrupt then they found it, both for words, and for pronouncing: So that, I rather thinke the barbarous people to have beene a cause of increasing the corruption, and of further altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and departure of those Languages from the <hi>Roman,</hi> than of beginning them. And me thinkes I have very good reasons so to be perswaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all the arguments above mentioned, which I produced, both for the remaining of the vulgar Languages, and for the unperfect speaking of the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue in the Provinces, First, because the <hi>Gothes, Wandales, Langbards,</hi> as also the <hi>Franks,</hi> and <hi>Burgundions</hi> language, was by the consent of<note n="*" place="margin">Irenic.

Secondly, because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the ancient writers (and they are many) which have written of the miserable changes, made in these West parts of the world, by those infinite swarmes of barbarous people, I finde not one, that mentioneth the change of any of these languages to have beene caused by them: which me thinkes some ancient writers among so many learned, as those times, and those very Countries abounded withall, and whose writings yet remaine, would certainely have recorded. But though we finde mention in sundry ancient writers, of changing these languages into the <hi>Roman</hi> (whom yet I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of that unperfect change before touched) yet nothing is found of any rechanging of those

               <p>One is out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Platonique questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in quaest. plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. quaest. 9.</note> affirming that in his time all men in a manner spake the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue.</p>
               <p>Another before touched that <hi>Strabo</hi> recordeth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:172339:35"/> the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue to have beene spoken in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>

               <p>A third, how it falleth, if these vulgar tongues of adulterate <hi>Latin</hi> be so ancient, that nothing is found written in any of them of any great antiquity?</p>
               <p>A fourth, how in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Latium,</hi> where the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue was, out of question, native, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> could so degenerate, at this day is found in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, except by some forraine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>
               <p>To the first of these I answere, eyther that as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are wont to interpret many generall proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Plutarch</hi> is to be understood <hi>de generibus sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum,</hi> not <hi>de singulis generum:</hi> So that the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue was spoken almost in every Nation, but not of every one in any forraine Nation: Or else, that they spake the <hi>Latine</hi> indeed, but yet unperfectly, and corruptly as their tongues would frame to utter it.</p>
               <p>To the second I answere: first, that <hi>Strabo</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not generally of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> but with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to certaine parts of both, the Province of <hi>Narbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the tract about <hi>Baetis</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Secondly, that although they speake it, yet it followeth not, that they speake it perfectly, and aright (except perhaps in the Colonies) so that I will not deny but it might be spoken abroad in the Provinces, yet I say it was spoken corruptly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the peoples tongues would fashion to it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172339:35"/> namely in such sort, that although the matter, and body of the words, were for the most part Latine, yet the forme, and sound of them varied from the right pronouncing: which speech notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was named <hi>Latine,</hi> partly for the reason now touched, and partly, because they learned it from the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Latines,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call their language <hi>Romance</hi> till this day, which yet we know to differ much from the right <hi>Roman</hi> tongue:<note place="margin">Nithard. de dissens. filior.

Thirdly, to the objection of <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and <hi>Augustines</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in <hi>Latine,</hi> I answer, that both * <hi>Hippo,</hi> whereof <hi>Augustine</hi> was Bishop, and<note n="*" place="margin">Plin.

Although neyther in the Colonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as it seemeth) the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncorrupt, both for that which I alleaged before out of <hi>Spartianus</hi> of <hi>Severus</hi> his sister dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Leptis,</hi> and for that which I remembred out of <hi>Augustine</hi> for <hi>Hippo,</hi> where they spake<note n="*" place="margin">Enar.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:172339:36"/> corruptions, where yet (as it is like) their most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> had not place.</p>
               <p>To the third, I answere, that two reasons of it may be assigned: One, that learned men would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write, in the learned, and grammaticall, then in the vulgar, and provinciall <hi>Latine.</hi> Another, that the workes of unlearned men would hardly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue till our times, seeing even of the learned anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writings, but few of infinite, have remayned. Furthermore it is observed of the <hi>German</hi> tongue, by <hi>Tschudas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tschud. de script. Alpinae cap. 36. Genebr. l. 4. Chron. Sec. 11.</note> and of the <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Genebrard,</hi> that it is very little above 400 yeeres, since bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be written in both those Languages, and yet it is out of all doubt, that the tongues are much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter.</p>
               <p>To the fourth I say, that there is no language which of ordinary course is not subject to change, although there were no forraine occasion at all: which the very fancies of men, weary of old words (as of old things) is able enough to worke, which may be well proved by observations, and instances of former changes, in this very tongue (the <hi>Latine</hi>) whereof I now dispute. For <hi>Quintilian</hi> recordeth, that the verses of the <hi>Salii,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quintil. Inst. Orator. l. 1▪ c▪ 6</note> which were sayd to be composed by <hi>Numa,</hi> could hardly be understood of their Priests, in the latter time of the common wealth, for the absolutenesse of the speech.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172339:36"/> The Lawes also of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, and of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri</hi> (called the Lawes of the twelve Tables) collected,<note place="margin">Fulv. Vrsin. not. ad Ant.

               <p>Furthermore <hi>Polybius</hi> hath also recorded,<note place="margin">Polyb. l. 3.</note> that the articles of league, betwixt the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Carthage,</hi> made presently after the expulsion of the Kings from <hi>Rome,</hi> could very hardly in his time be understood, by reason of the old forsaken words by any of the best skilled Antiquaries in <hi>Rome.</hi> In which time notwithstanding, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very few strangers into their City, which mixture might cause such alteration, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time was but about 350. yeeres.

                  </gap>, as if they had beene bred immediatly of the Earth, or borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moone. Another example whereof wee may see in <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe, for in the steepy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Granata,</hi> named <hi>Alpuxarras,</hi> the progeny of the <hi>Mores</hi> yet retaine the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue (for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it <hi>Araviga</hi>) which all the other remnants of the <hi>Mores</hi> in the plainer region had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

And (to let forraine instances goe) in the <hi>Brittaines</hi> or <hi>Welsh-men</hi> in the hilly part of our owne Countrey. What the reason thereof may be, I will not stand now curiously to enquire: whether that being inured to labour, to watching, to sundry distemperatures of the aire, and much other hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (for otherwise their living will not be gotten out of such barren ground) they prove upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion good and able souldiers? Or, that the craggy rockes and hilles (like fortresses of natures owne erecting) are easily defended from forraine inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Or that their unpleasant and fruitlesse soile, hath nothing to invite strangers to desire it? Or that wanting riches, they want also the ordinary companions of riches, that is proud and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts, to provoke with their injuries other Nations to be revenged on them, eyther by the conquest or desolation of their Countries? But whatsoever the cause may be, certainely in effect so it is, that the most ancient Nations and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, are for the most part to be found in such unpleasant and fruitlesse regions: Insomuch that the <hi>Biscaynes,</hi> who gave me occasion of this digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vaunt themselves among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they are the right <hi>Hidalgos</hi> (that is Gentlemen) as some also report of the <hi>Welsh-men</hi> here in <hi>Brittaine</hi>

               <p>But yet is not the <hi>Slavonique</hi> tongue (to answere your question) for all this large extent, the vulgar language of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire.

For else, being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and usuall; as it is in the Great <hi>Turkes Serrail</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and familiar with most of the <hi>Turkish</hi> souldiers, by reason of their garisons and other great imployment in those parts toward the confines of Christian Princes, all which parts as

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:172339:49"/> remaining after that time, onely among the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and being taught in schooles, as among us the learned tongues are accustomed to be. And yet, after the time of our Saviour, this language began much more to alter, and to depart further, both from the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as receaving much mixture of <hi>Greeke,</hi> some also of <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Arabique</hi> words, as in the <hi>Talmud</hi> (named of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>) gathered by R. <hi>Iochanan,</hi> about 300. yeeres after Christ, is apparent being farre fuller of them, than those parts of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrase on the holy Scriptures, which were made by R. <hi>Ionathan,</hi> a little before Christ, and by R. <hi>Aquila</hi> whom they call <hi>Onkelos,</hi> not long after.</p>
               <p>But yet certaine it is, both for the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the words themselves, which are in the <hi>Syriaque</hi> tongue for the most part <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and for the diversity of those adherents of words, which they call praefixa, and suffixa, as also, for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sound of some vowels, and sundry other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: Certaine it is I say, that the unlearned <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose vulgar speech the <hi>Syraque</hi> then was, could not understand their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that their lectures of <hi>Moses:</hi> and the Prophets, used in their synagogues in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue. And that seemeth to have beene the originall reason, both of the publique speeches, and declarations of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men to the people, usuall in their synagogues on the Sabbaoths, after the readings of the Law, and of the Prophets, whereof in the<note place="margin">Act. 13.1.</note> new Testament we finde some mention; and also, of the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and <hi>Onkelos,</hi> and others made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172339:50"/> their vulgar language, for that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> was so great, that the tongue of the one Nation could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the other. First, the tongues themselves, which yet remaine with us, may be evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, of which we see that one may bee skilfull in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and yet not understand the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and therefore neyther could they, whose speech the <hi>Chaldee</hi> then was (although, much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated) understand the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Secondly, wee find, that when<note n="*" place="margin">Nehem. ca. 8, v. 7, 8, 9.</note>

And Thirdly, the answere made to <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh,</hi> by the officers of K. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> may put it out of question: willing him<note n="*" place="margin">Reg. l. 2, cap. 18, v. 26.</note> to speake unto them in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> tongue, that the common people of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) in whose hearing it was) might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what was spoken. But yet it might be, that as at this day the Iewes use to do, so also in Christs time of conversing on the Earth, they might also reade the <hi>Chaldee Targamin</hi> (and certainely some<note n="*" place="margin">Iunius in Bellarm.

               <p>But yet indeed, in the more Southerly parts of <hi>Asia</hi> (especially in those where Christianity was first planted, and had taken deepest roote) as <hi>Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Syria, Palestine, Chaldaea, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Media, Persia,</hi> the North part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the South of <hi>India,</hi> Christians are not onely to be found, but in certaine of those regions, as in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia,, Armenia, Syria, Mesopotamia,</hi> somewhat thicke mingled with <hi>Mahumetans:</hi> as they are also in the South of <hi>India</hi> not farre from the promontory of <hi>Comoriin,</hi> in some reasonable number, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Contan,</hi> of <hi>Cranganor,</hi> and of <hi>Choromandeb,</hi> but mingled with Idolaters.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172339:56"/> compare in any sort, with the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and much lesse with the Idolaters among whom they live.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with Christians in the firme Land of <hi>Asia:</hi> but in the Ilands about <hi>Asia,</hi> Christianity is as yet but a tender plant▪ for although it hath made some entrance into the Iles called <hi>Philippinas,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into 30 of them, for so many onely of 11000 termed by that name, are subject to the King of <hi>Spaine, Th.

For it hath ever beene the condition of the conquered, to follow for the most part the religion of the conquerors. A second, their peremptory restraint, (even on the paine of death) of all disputation touching their religion, and calling any poynt of it into question. A third, their suppression of the study of Philosophy, by the light whereof, the grossenes, and vanity of many parts of their religion might be discovered, which is inhibited to be taught in their universities, and so hath beene, about these 400 yeeres, whereas till then, it greatly flourished among them, in <hi>Cordoua,</hi> in <hi>Fess,</hi> in <hi>Maroccho,</hi> in <hi>Bagded,</hi> and other Cities.

               <p>And thus have I declared the three principall sects as touching Religion, that are at this present found in the severall parts of the World, with their particular regions.

For all the Nations of <hi>Asia</hi> from the great rivers of <hi>Wolgha</hi> and <hi>Oby,</hi> Eastward, and from the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea, the river <hi>Oxus,</hi> the Countries of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>China</hi> Northward, are contained under the Appellation of <hi>Tartars:</hi> and yet without these

And what if the innumerable people of so many Nations, as are knowne to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite &amp; overspread the huge continent of <hi>America,</hi> be also of the same off-spring? Certainely, if I be not greatly deceived, they are no other. For first that their originall must be derived from <hi>Asia</hi> is apparent, because, (as he that readeth the relations and histories of those Countries of <hi>America</hi> may easily observe) they have no rellish nor resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance at all, of the Artes, or learning or civility of <hi>Europe:</hi> And their colour testifieth, they are not of the <hi>Africans</hi> progeny (there being not found in all that large continent, any blacke men, except a few about the River of S. <hi>Martha,</hi> in a small Countrey called <hi>Quarequa:</hi> which by force and violence of some tempest, are supposed to have beene trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thither, from the parts of <hi>Guiny</hi> or <hi>Aethic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>) Therefore it seemeth, that they had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall from <hi>Asia.</hi> Which yet, will appeare more credible, if it be observed, which by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> discoveries is well knowen to be true, namely, that the West side of <hi>America</hi> respecting <hi>Asia,</hi> is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much better peopled than the opposite or East side, that respecteth toward <hi>Europe.</hi> And, as for these reasons it is very likely, that <hi>America</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her first inhabitants, from the East border of <hi>Asia:</hi> So is it altogether unlike, that it received them from any other part of all that border, save from <hi>Tartary.</hi> Because in <hi>America</hi> there is not to be discerned, any token or indication at all, of the arts or industry of <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>Cataia,</hi> or any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:172339:73"/> other civill region, along all that border of <hi>Asia:</hi> But in their grosse ignorance of letters, and of arts, in their idolatry, and the specialties of it, in their incivility, and many barbarous properties, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the old and rude <hi>Tartars,</hi> above all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth. Which opinion of mine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Americans</hi> descending from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from any other Nation in that border of <hi>Asia,</hi> after the neere vicinity of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> this reason above all other, may best establish and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade: because it is certaine, that the Northeast part of <hi>Asia</hi> possessed by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> is if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent with the West side of <hi>America,</hi> which yet remayneth somewhat doubtfull: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and without all doubt, it is the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by sea, of all that coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> for that those parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> are continent one with the other, or at most, disjoyned but by some narrow channell of the Ocean, the ravenous and harmefull beasts, wherewith <hi>America</hi> is stored, as Beares, Lyons, Tigers, Wolves, Foxes, &amp;c. (which men, as is likely, would never to their owne harme transport out of the one continent to the other) may import. For from <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, which rested after the deluge, in <hi>Asia,</hi> all those beasts must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity fetch their beginning, seeing they could not proceed by the course of nature, as the unperfect sort of living creatures doe, of Putrefaction: or if they might have Putrefaction for their parentage, or receive their originall (by any other new sort of generation) of the earth, without speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of their owne kinde, then I see no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,

Wherefore, seeing it is certaine, that those ravenous beasts of <hi>America,</hi> are the progeny of those of the same kinde in <hi>Asia,</hi> and that men, as is likely, conveyed them not (to their owne prejudice) from the one continent to the other, it carrieth a great likelihood and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of truth, that if they joyne not together, yet are they neere neighbours, and but little disjoyned each from other, for even to this day, in the iles of <hi>Cuba, Iamaica, Hispaniola, Burichena,</hi> and all the rest, which are so farre removed from the firme land, that these beasts cannot swim from it to them,<note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Because it is utterly against the nature of water, being a flexible and ponderous body, so to consist, and stay it selfe, and not fall to the lower parts about it, where in nature there is nothing at all to hinder it. Or, if it be hindred and restrayned supernaturally, by the hand and bridle of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, lest it should overwhelme and drowne the Land, it must follow thereof, that God in the very institution of nature, imposed a perpetuall violence upon nature: And this withall, that at the deluge, there had beene no necessity at all, to breake up the springs of the deepe, and to open the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of Heaven, and powre downe water continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so many dayes and nights together upon the earth, seeing, the onely withdrawing of that hand, or letting goe of that bridle, which restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the water, would presently have overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all.</p>
               <p>But, to come to the poynt. It seemeth upon the former suppositions (of which, the holy Scripture established the first, experience of Travailers, and Navigators the second, and Reason the third) that in making estimation of the depth of the Sea, we are not to reckon and consider onely, the height of the Hilles, above the common <hi>superficies</hi> of the earth, unto which the extraordinary depthes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:172339:82"/> or whirlpooles, that are found in the Sea, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly answere (descending beneath the ordinary bottome of the Sea, as the hilles ascend above the ordinary face of the Land) but the advantage or height of all the dry Land above the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Sea. Because the whole Masse of the Earth that now appeareth above the waters, being taken as it were out of the place, which the waters now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, must be equall to the place out of which it was taken, and consequently it seemeth, that the height or elevation of the one, should answere the depth or descending of the other. And therefore as I sayd, in estimating the deepenesse of the Sea, we are not to consider onely the erection of the Hilles, above the ordinary land, but the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all the dry land above the sea. Which later, I meane the height of the ordinary maine Land, (even excluding the hilles) is in my opinion more in large Continents above the Sea, than that of the Hilles, is above the Land. For first, that the plaine and common face of the dry Land, is not levell, or equally distant from the Center, but hath great declivity, and descent toward the Sea, and acclivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or rising toward the Midland parts, although it appeare not so to the common view of the Eye, is to reason notwithstanding manifest. Because as it is found in that part of the earth, which the Sea covereth that it descendeth lower, and lower to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the middest of the Sea, (for the Sea which touching the upper face of it, is knowne to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell by nature, and evenly distant from the Center, is withall observed to waxe deeper, and deeper, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:172339:83"/> farther one sayleth from the shore toward the maine) Even so, in that part which is uncovered, the coursings, and streamings of rivers on all sides from the midland parts toward the Sea,<note n="*" place="margin">By which rule of the proceeding of Rivers by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity of the earth and ever sliding from the higher ground to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till they come to the Sea, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that in Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, those Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the higher land from which Rivers streame, and those the lower ground, to which they proceede, and consequently, that of all, those are the highest which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no forraine Rivers, to which they give passage through them, doe send forth the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Rivers on all sides to the regions round about them.

And as the region also about the springs of <hi>Nilus,</hi> from which beside <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that runneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, are sent forth, the river of <hi>Magnice,</hi> towards the south, of <hi>Zaire</hi> West, of <hi>Coavo,</hi> and <hi>Zuama</hi> East, being (<hi>Neger</hi> excepted) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test rivers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi> is by the same reason, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of that continent.</note> whose property we know is to slide from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the lower, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so much.</p>

It being first supposed, which upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act consideration, and calculation, will be found to swarve very little from the truth, that the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe, Afrique, Asia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> are as 1. 3. 4. &amp; 7.

So that, if we divide the knowne regions of the world, into 30 equall parts. The Christians part is as five, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> as sixe, and the Idolaters as nineteene, for the poore dispersed, and distressed Christians, which are found in <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                  <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and Idolaters, I receive not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this account, both because they were but thinne dispersed, in respect of the multitudes of <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and Idolaters in those regions among whom they live (being withall under their dominion) and because also, many <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> are found min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled among Christians in <hi>Europe,</hi> to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and countervaile a great part of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>Such therefore may be the generall proportion of Christians to <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and Idolaters, in the continents of the earth hitherto discovered, namely, in this our neighbour continent of the East com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <hi>Europe, Afrique,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and in that other continent of the West, called <hi>America,</hi> and in the Ilands belonging to them both.

                  <hi>Beach,</hi> over against <hi>Iava,</hi> they were found to be so: And also, because they are knowne to be no other than Idolaters, that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite all those parts of the other continents, that neighbour most towards them, from whom it is likely, they should have received the change of their religion, if any were: for first, in <hi>Asia,</hi> both
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:172339:87"/>
                  <hi>India,</hi> and the Ilands of the <hi>Indian</hi> sea, whereof some lie close on the South continent.

               <p>Now that the South continent is no lesse than I before esteemed it, namely, than that of <hi>Asia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> altogether, although I might be probably induced to beleeve so, because it is well knowne, both (touching latitude) to approach in some parts neere the equator, and (touching longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) to runne along in a continuall circuite about the earth, fronting both the other continents: Yet have I also another reason of more certaine importance, to perswade me: Namely, because it is well knowne, that the land to the North side of the line, in the other continents (the old, and new world) yet altogether is at least foure times as large as that part of them which lieth to the south. Now, forasmuch as it is certaine, first by <hi>Archimedes</hi> his rule,<note place="margin">Archimed. de Insidentib. Aquae. l. 1.

                              <p>For touching the first of these suppositions. It is the property of water, ever to fall that way, where it findeth declivity. Wherefore, if the water, in the upper face of it, were higher in one place than in another, it would necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall, from the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:172339:87"/> to the lower, because it is heavy, and flexible, and hath nothing in the open, and free Sea, to let or hinder it. And consequently, would never rest setled, and stable, till the face of it were levelled, in an even distance from the center.</p>
                              <p>And touching the second, if the earth were unequally poysed on opposite sides of the center, then must it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the least, and lighter masse of the earth should presse downe as forcibly, as the greater, and weightier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it attayneth the center as well as it. But if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, which reason doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, that the weightier part of the earth, should presse downeward, with greater force, &amp; with more right chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the center, than the lighter part: it must follow, that the lighter masse or side of the earth, must yeeld, and give place to the weightier, so farre, till the center of that whole masse of the earth take possession of the center of the world (for till then, one
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:172339:88"/> side will be still heavier than the other) and so the opposit halfes of the earth in respect of heavinesse, be brought on all sides, about the center, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect equilibration.</p>
                              <p>And the third may be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by manifest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. Because, a clod of earth, suffered to fall from any poynt of the aire, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever on the face of the sea (the same doth water, falling on even and plaine land) when all is calme, and the ayre not troubled with winds, nor the sea with waves, will descend by a perpendicular line, on the face of the water. In such sort I say, that the line by which it falleth maketh exactly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and right angles on all sides, with the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereon it falleth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifest, that the earth so falling, tendeth dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to the center of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Because no straight line insisteth perpendicularly, on the face or circumference of any speciall body (as the water is) except only those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:172339:88"/> directly to the center of the sphere: But certaine it is, that the earth is withall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly carried toward it owne center, therefore there is but one common center of the water, and of the earth.</p>

And thirdly, that the cen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of the earth and of the water are all one (both of them being indeed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the center of the world) which though some phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall heads have called into question yet no sound philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher ever doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: It followeth thereupon, that the earth should in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable measure and proportion, lift it selfe, and appeare above the face of the sea, on the south side of the line, as it doth on the North.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:172339:88"/> And consequently, that what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the South parts of the two foresaid continents towards the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervayling of the North parts (which is about three five parts of both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continents lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together) must of necessity be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of the South. And yet I omit all the land, that may be about the <hi>Arcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> Pole, beyond the <hi>Scythian</hi> or <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian</hi> sea, which must be also coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoysed in that <hi>Antarctique</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for nothing comes within the compasse of my understanding, to be hereto replyed, except any would perhaps imagine, that eyther the sea
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:172339:88"/> on the South side of the Aequator, is very shallow, or that the land of that continent may be much higher above the face of the sea, than the land of the other 2. (and so in equall masse, though lesse in circuit) or that the earth on the south side of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, should be of a more ponderous disposition than on the north, in w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> cases, some compensation of weightines, may be made for the want of extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But of these three, the experience of saylers evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently refelleth the first, who in equall distance from the land, observe an equall deepenesse of the sea, in both south, and north latitude. And neither is there any experience, nor good reason that can be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to establish eyther of the later: which, but that I have already too much offended by digressions, I could prove I doubt not against all exception. But this for a conclusion to this discourse, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce touching that south continent, that it will certainely be found (in the after times, when it shall be better discovered) much larger than any globe or map hitherto extant, hath represented it.</p>
               <p>Such therefore (as I have declared) is the generall state of Christianity at this present in the world, &amp; the proportion of it to other religions. But because you require yet further to be especially informed of the divers sorts and sects of Christians that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, and withall of their divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and religions, at least of those principall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters

               <p>Of which great extendment of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs jurisdiction, if you demand the reason: I have observed sundry occasions, from whence it hath proceeded. For first, his originall or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority assigned, or rather confirmed to him (as Bishop of the Imperiall city) by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> contained all the Provinces of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and of <hi>Anatolia, (Isauria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> onely excepted,<note place="margin">Concil.

Secondly, the voluntary submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Grecians</hi> upon their separation from the <hi>Latine</hi> Church greatly increased it: for thereby not onely <hi>Greece, Macedon, Epirus, Candy,</hi> and the Iles about <hi>Greece</hi> (in all seven Provinces) came under his obedience, but also <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the East poynt of <hi>Italy,</hi> named <hi>Calabria,</hi> revolted from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for a long time, pertained to

               <p>And, this heresie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> springing out of that bitter roote of the <hi>Iacobites,</hi> touching one onely nature in Christ, was the last of that long and wicked traine of heresies, which upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> exceedingly wasted, and ruined the East Church, for after that the detestation of <hi>Nestorius</hi> heresie, touching two Persons in our Saviour, condemned in the third generall Councell) had so immoderately distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the phantasies of <hi>Eutyches</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria, Dioscorus</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their adherents, that they thought not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves safe enough from the heresie of two persons, till they were fallen into the other, and opposite extremity of one nature in Christ, the Divine and humane natures in Christ (in their conceits) by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion and confusion of substances, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties growing into one, upon their adunation: and with all, that the humane nature of Christ was not consubstantiall to ours, but of another kind, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172339:118"/> condition, which phantasies, the 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell condemned. After I say this heresie of <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> had growne to that head in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> that like a violent, and furious streame, whose course would not be stayed, it bare downe before it all oppositions, and among the rest, that great and reverend Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that had condemned it, and was condemned by it it gave occasion for an infinite traine of heresies to follow at the breach, which it had made.</p>
               <p>For first (to omit infinite extravagant branches,<note place="margin">Vid. Nicephor Histor. Eccles. l. 18, c. 45, &amp; sequent. Leont. de Sectis. Action. 5, &amp;c.</note> that sprang from it, and infinitely deformed the Church, renting with many schismes the unity, and with as many heresies wounding the faith of it) It drew after it, the heresie of the passiblenesse of the Deity, because the Deity of Christ, was become (in their conceits) the same nature with the humanity, that was passible. Secondly, (the absurdity of that being discerned) it occasioned another extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite, namely of the Impassibility of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Saviour, (but on the same ground) because namely, it was become one nature with the Deity, which now we know to be unpassible. Thirdly, when the fondnesse of both were discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, It bred a new devise, touching one nature in our Saviour (as the wit of <hi>Heretiques</hi> will better serve them, to devise a thousand shifts to delude the truth, than their pride will suffer them once to yeeld, and acknowledge it) It bred, I say, a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, namely, to be one, not by permixtion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of substances, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> first taught, but onely by composition, the Deity and humanity,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:172339:119"/> by coalition becomming one nature in Christ, as the body, and soule grow into one nature in Man. And fourthly, when this phantasie began also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to abate, and relent in many: yet still a fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it were or rather a consequent of it was retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (for indeed it implyeth by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the unity of nature) namely that there was but one will, and one action of both natures in the person of our Saviour. And God knowes what a traine and succession of heresies might have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed these, if that Lord whom they had infinitely wronged by their wanton, and wandring conceits of him, had not, to stop the course, and streame of their wickednesse, and folly, brought on them the <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> for even while the Church, specially that of the Easterne parts, was in great perplexity, and travaile, with the heresie of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites</hi> (which I last mentioned) the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> like a mighty inundation brake forth, and overwhelmed all, and them first, that first, and most had wronged the Sonne of God, by fostering the forenamed heresies, and the infinite broode that sprung of them, I meane <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and to this day, both they, and the neighbouring Nations that had beene infected by them, remaine in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But yet as in the diseases, and distempers of our bodies, contraries are usually healed by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so seemeth it to have fallen out in the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of these mens religions, for as worldly prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and wantonnesse of wit (ordinary companions) wherewith these Nations in those times aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, bred in them their ordinary children, namely,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:172339:119"/> prosperity of the world, pride, and wantonnesse of wit, errour, which couple in matter of fayth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is wont to produce no better issue than he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. So on the other side having now at length, their hearts humbled, and their wits tamed by that poverty, and affliction, wherein the tyranny, and oppression of th e <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> hath long holden them, it seemeth the Lord hath taken pity on them (as it is his property not to despise humble and broken spirits, and to remember mercy in the middest of judgement) and reduced them, or the most of them, to the right acknowledgment of his sonne againe. For certainely, that they and other Christians of the East, have (at least in these latter times) disclaymed, and abandoned, those hereticall phantasies touching our Saviour, wherein by their misleaders they had beene anciently plunged (and which many Christians of these West parts, still charge them withall) doth manifestly appeare.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ongues are eyther Mother tongues, or dialects: Mother tongues are those, out of which many dialects, as it were, so many branches are drawne. These branches of one mother tongue have some affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one with another; but betweene the mother tongues themselves is no affinity or correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
               <p>The mother tongues which are so wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from another, are in number eleven; of which, foure are more noble; the other seven of lesse dignity: those we will call the greater; these the lesser mother tongues. The same word in the originall tongue, by divers inflexions, and variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons makes divers dialects: as the same word in Latine diversly varied, produces the Italian, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and French dialect. So the Latine cals a sonne in law <hi>Gener,</hi> the Italian <hi>Genero,</hi> the Spanish <hi>Yerno</hi>

               <p>The foure chiefe mother tongues are Latine <hi>(Deus)</hi> Greeke (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Dutch <hi>(Godt)</hi> and Slavonian <hi>(Boge.)</hi> The characters of the Slavonian tongue are of two kindes: the Russian or Moscovite, which seeme to be nothing but the Greeke letters corrupted, being equall to them in number, and very like to them in figure: excepting some few barbarous letters which are added. The other are Dalmatian, which are of the same sound, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in number, but of a farre differing figure. So that there is a double translation of the Bible, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, the Russian, which is the later, and the Dalmatian or Hieronymian, which is the more ancient. The Slavonian tongue is derived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many dialects: the Russian, Polonian, Boemian, Illyricks, Dalmatian, Windicke, and others that may be added.</p>
               <p>The German tongue hath also divers dialects, or idiomes: the chiefe of which are Dutch, Saxon, and Danish: of the Dutch there are two idiomes or dialects, the high Dutch which pronounce <hi>Wasser,</hi> and the low Dutch, which pronounce <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which the Saxons, and Danes pronounce in the same manner. The branches of the Saxon are the dialects of the North-Albingi, the Frisians, and the English: although the dialects of the North-Albingi and Turingii, seeme to be meere English, and Scottish.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:172339:128"/>
               <p>Of the Danish language there are three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, 1. of the borders or marches, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Denmarke,</hi> 2. of the South-Danes, which is <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> 3. of the North-danes which is <hi>Norway:</hi> from whom they of <hi>Iseland</hi> borrow their language, for they understand one another, as the Hollanders understand the high-Dutch, or the Italians, the French.</p>
               <p>The third Mother-tongue is the Latine, from which have beene derived the Italian, French, and Spanish: all which in a barbarous word have beene called <hi>Romanse,</hi> as you would say Roman: for in <hi>Italy</hi> the Lombards, and in <hi>Spaine</hi> the Gothes were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the Romans.</p>
               <p>The Greeke hath sundry idiomes, and dialects, which is not to be wondred at, in a countrey consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of so many Ilands: which as they differ one from another in place, so in propriety of speech. And so much of the foure greater or nobler mother tongues.</p>
               <p>There are seven other prime or mother-langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but of lesse worth, and dignity than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: the first is the Albanian, of a people in the Mountaines of <hi>Epirus:</hi> the second is that of the Cosaches, and Tartars: the third is the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which came out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> with the Huns: the fourth is of the people of <hi>Finland,</hi> neere to which is that of <hi>Lapland,</hi> in the North part of <hi>Sueden:</hi> the fifth is the Irish, which the wilde Scots also speake: the sixth is the Welsh, or the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Brittish, of which <hi>Britanny</hi> in <hi>France</hi> hath some touch: the seventh is Biscay, which is the reliques
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:172339:129"/> of old Spanish: this Country lies on this side, and beyond the Pyrenean Mountaines at least seven dayes journey.</p>
               <p>These are the eleven mother languages, which are so distinguished, that they have no affinity one with another: but they have beene subject part of them to the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and part to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> their characters were of five kinds, Latine, Greeke, Dalmatian, Russian, and Gothish: for the ancient Gothes have their chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters proper to themselves. In their rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they imitate the Greekes, but therein use the old Gothish tongue, otherwise in common use, for the most part, they speake German.</p>
               <p>We have sayd before, that the branches of the Latine or Roman tongue are French, Italian, and Spanish: of the French we will speake somewhat, as being the most neate, elegant, and pleasant of all the vulgar tongues. The French therefore hath two chiefe dialects; that of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the other of <hi>Provence: Languedoc</hi> is the true, and proper French idiome, so called as <hi>Langued'ouy,</hi> a language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they say <hi>ouy,</hi> or <hi>oe,</hi> for a note of affirmation, as we say in English <hi>yea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Languedoc</hi> or French idiome, there are two corrupt dialects or deviations; that is the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and that of <hi>Poictou;</hi> All those of the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which speake not Dutch, are Wallons; and this language is used from the Countrey of <hi>Liege,</hi> almost as farre as <hi>Paris;</hi> the language of which two places (although they both speake French) is so different, that a trades-man of <hi>Paris,</hi> will hardly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:172339:129"/> a boore or countrey-man of the countrey of <hi>Liege.</hi> The Language of <hi>Poictou</hi> is that which is spoken, betweene <hi>Tours</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Provenciall dialect is of two sorts, the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoigne,</hi> and the <hi>Limosin,</hi> and these be the dialects of the French, as it is a branch of the Roman: beside which there are two others, which have no affinity with the Roman or Latine: those are the Britaine, which seemes not to differ much from our Cornish: and the Biscay, which is used in the mountainous countrey, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
